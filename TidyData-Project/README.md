## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to familiarize the user with how to clean and tidy a disorganized and inefficient dataset. This dataset, *Mutant Moneyball*, was adapted from an article by Rally, visualizing X-Men value data from 1963 to 1993. While it contains interesting information, this information is unusable without the proper caretaking.This goal of this project is to transform this dataset into one that can be analyzed and visualized.

This project demonstrates core tiny data principles, including transforming the dataset so that each variable is in its own column, each observation forms its own row, and each type of observational unit forms its own table. This project also encourages interesting data visualization practices by using tools such as seaborn.

## Instructions
**Follow these steps in order to run the notebook:*

### Step 1: Downloading and Setup
1. **Download a copy of the Jupyter notebook.**
Download the file 'mutant_moneyball.ipynb' from the 'DuBay-Python-Portfolio' repository. Open the notebook in VSCode or your preferred enviornment.

2. **Download the dataset.**
Open the dataset you will be working with. In this case, this is 'mutant_moneyball.csv', which can also be found in this repository.

3. **Ensure you have necessary software to proceed.**
This includes installing the Python libraries Panda, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
*If you do not know how to download these, you can use **pip install** followed by the software.*

### Step 2: Running
Run the pre-created notebook cells **IN ORDER** to ensure proper performance. This includes, but is not limited to:
    - Loading the dataset
    - Melting the dataset
    - Tidying the dataset
    - Creating visualizations with the dataset
    - Generating a pivot table with the dataset

If you get stuck during this process, look for the markdown cells as well as the comments left within the code itself.

## Dataset Description
The Mutant Moneyball dataset holds information related to the Rally article of the same name, written about the value of X-Men comics over a 30-year period. This dataset includes details pertaining to decade, source, and price as they relate to the member.

## Visual Examples
Due to an unforseen error with the dataset, some of the sources have not been appearing in the visualizations. This is unfortunate, as it takes away from the effectiveness of the visuals. However, this hiccup is a lesson for all people getting involved in data analysis and visualization: you may run into issues, but you should never give up. I will continue to search for the root of this error until this mistake is rectified.

In the meantime, however, I have still chosen to include some of the visualizations from the Tidy Data Mutant Moneyball project. They are seen below:
