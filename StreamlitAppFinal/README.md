This is the home page README file for my Streamlit Final Project. I hope this page provides insight into why I created this app as well as teaches those about the programming behind it.

## Project Overview 🧩:
In this project, I built Streamlit game called **Timeline**, which was based on the New York Times mini game, Flashback. The purpose of this project is to tap into my creative side, allowing me to fully brainstorm, design, and code my own application. I also created this game to teach people that coding– and history!– can be really fun when you add a twist. I hope it not only encourages people to brush up on their history facts, but also to make them excited about the endless possibilities of coding.

I created my own dataset for this project ![Dataset Reference](historical_events.csv), in which I chose five events from each week of the year. These events span centuries and make for a fun historical quiz game in which the player must sort the events chronologically. The application also keeps track of your overall accurracy for a more competitive twist. 😁
