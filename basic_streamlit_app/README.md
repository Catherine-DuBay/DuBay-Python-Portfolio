#### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ This is **My First App: Penguins!**

- âš¡ This app allows the user to filter the dataset based on penguin island, body mass, and species.
- ðŸ”¬ This app allows users to examine smaller penguins from various islands and species.
- ðŸŒ± This app is a great introduction to streamlit apps.

1) First, the user selects an island. This prompts the app to display all penguins on that island, including a total number.
2) Next, the user uses a slider to choose the maximum weight of the penguins they want to examine. The app then displays all penguins who from that island and below that weight, along with a total number.
3) Finally, the user selects a species. This prompts the app to display all penguins of that species who are below the desired weight on the desired island.

In order to run the app:

The user should open the file in VSCode. 

The user should open the code in an integrated terminal.

The user should verify that they are in the correct directory (basic_streamlit_app).

The user should type "streamlit run main.py".


The app should open in a browser where a user can then enjoy the app!
