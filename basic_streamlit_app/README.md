# Hello! 👋 This is **My First App: Penguins!**

### 🔗 [Link](https://penguins-basic.streamlit.app) to Penguins Streamlit App.

This is the home page README file for my first ever Streamlit app. I hope this page teaches you how to use the app and encourages you to explore this dataset.

## Project Overview 🧩:
⚡ This app allows the user to filter the dataset based on penguin island, body mass, and species.
🔬 This app allows users to examine smaller penguins from various islands and species.
🌱 This app is a great introduction to streamlit apps.

## App Features 👩‍💻:
1) First, the user selects an island. This prompts the app to display all penguins on that island, including a total number.
2) Next, the user uses a slider to choose the maximum weight of the penguins they want to examine. The app then displays all penguins who from that island and below that weight, along with a total number.
3) Finally, the user selects a species. This prompts the app to display all penguins of that species who are below the desired weight on the desired island.

## Instructions 📋:
1. The user should open the file in VSCode. 

2. The user should open the code in an integrated terminal.

3. The user should verify that they are in the correct directory (basic_streamlit_app).

4. The user should type "streamlit run main.py".

5. The app should open in a browser where a user can then enjoy the app!

## Visual Examples 🖼️:

##### This is the page that greets the user when they open the app. It provides instructions for operating the app as well as displaying the penguins dataset.

##### The user can select the island they want to examine. After that, they will find a count of the number of penguins on that island as well as the dataset with penguins from that island.

##### The user can select a maximum body mass value, viewing only penguins below that mass. It will again display the number of penguins and the dataset.

##### Finally, the user can select a species. It will again display the number of penguins and datasets. This way, they can only view the penguins from that island, of that species, below that body mass.
