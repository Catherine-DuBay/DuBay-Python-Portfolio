# Hello! 👋 This is my **Elements of Computing II Python Portfolio**.

### Beginning of the Semester Reflection: 

In this repository, I will store all of my projects for the upcoming semester. 

- 💬 I am comfortable working with platforms such as VSCode.
- 🔭 I am  excited to use features such as streamlit, pandas, and seaborn.
- ⚡ I am looking forward to learning more about GitHub and building my portfolio.

# **Projects:**

Together, these projects create a **well-rounded portfolio** that demonstrates my technical range (from data analysis to NLP to web apps), creativity, and practical application of programming concepts. The progression from basic data visualization to more complex applications shows growth in my programming journey.

## Timeline: The Historical Event Challenge! 🕰️
#### 🔗 [Link](https://timeline-final.streamlit.app) to Timeline Streamlit App.

### This project demonstrates my ability to code imaginatively, combining my skills and knowledge with my creative side.

  - 📔 Tests players' knowledge of history in an exciting game format.
  - 🎯 Uses scoring system to track accuracy and keep players engaged. 
  - ✨ Inspires players to use their imagination to code creatively. 

### How does this complement my portfolio? 🤝

- ✅ Shows creativity in applying programming to educational contexts.
- ✅ Demonstrates implementation of scoring systems and game mechanics.
- ✅ Combines historical knowledge with technical implementation.

## Named Entity Recognition Program 📱
#### 🔗 [Link](https://ner-main.streamlit.app) to NER Streamlit App.

### This project demonstrates my ability to combine programs like spaCy and streamlit to create an application.

 - 👩‍💻 Familiarizes users with entity recognition software and visualizations through spaCy and streamlit.
 - 🛜 Allows users to upload or input their own text and create custom Entity Rulers.
 - 💭 Highlights different entities for streamlined identification and understanding. 

### How does this complement my portfolio? 🤝

- ✅ Shows proficiency with specialized NLP tools like spaCy.
- ✅ Demonstrates ability to work with text processing and entity extraction.
- ✅ Allows for custom rule creation, showing adaptability and customization skills.

## Tidy Data Project: Mutant Moneyball 💸

### This project demonstrates my ability to both clean and visualize data for more effective learning.

  - 🧹 Focuses on tidying and cleaning datasets, which in turn demonstrates tidy data principles.
  - 🦸 Works with the mutant_moneyball.csv dataset, which is adapted from a Rally article about X-Men.
  - 🧭 Teaches key concepts of data visualization and pivot tables for more efficient data analysis.

### How does this complement my portfolio? 🤝

- ✅ Focuses on the critical professional skill of data wrangling.
- ✅ Demonstrates  ability to work with messy, real-world datasets.
- ✅ Shows practical application of pivot tables and visualization techniques.

## Basic Streamlit App: Penguins 🐧
#### 🔗 [Link](https://penguins-basic.streamlit.app) to Penguins Streamlit App.

### This project demonstrates my ability work with real datasets in order to build a basic website app.

  - 🧑‍💻 Introduces users to basic streamlit browser apps and their critical functions.
  - ✈️ Filters the dataset based on user selections, including penguin island, body mass, and species.
  - 📍 Encourages users to work with features such as sliders and dropbox selections.

  ### How does this complement my portfolio? 🤝

  - ✅ Demonstrates ability to create simple but functional web interfaces.
  - ✅ Shows implementation of interactive filtering components.
  - ✅ Works with real biological data in an accessible application.
