# Hello! 👋 This is my **Elements of Computing II Python Portfolio**.

In this repository, I will store all of my projects for the upcoming semester. 

- 💬 I am comfortable working with platforms such as VSCode.
- 🔭 I am  excited to use features such as streamlit, pandas, and seaborn.
- ⚡ I am looking forward to learning more about GitHub and building my portfolio.

# **Projects:**

## Tidy Data Project: Mutant Moneyball 💸

This project demonstrates my ability to both clean and visualize data for more effective learning.

  - 🧹 Focuses on tidying and cleaning datasets, which in turn demonstrates tidy data principles.
  - 🦸 Works with the mutant_moneyball.csv dataset, which is adapted from a Rally article about X-Men.
  - 🧭 Teaches key concepts of data visualization and pivot tables for more efficient data analysis.

## Basic Streamlit App: Penguins 🐧

This project demonstrates my ability work with real datasets in order to build a basic website app.

  - 🧑‍💻 Introduces users to basic streamlit browser apps and their critical functions.
  - ✈️ Filters the dataset based on user selections, including penguin island, body mass, and species.
  - 📍 Encourages users to work with features such as sliders and dropbox selections.
