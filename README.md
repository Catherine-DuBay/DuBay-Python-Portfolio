#### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is **Catherine DuBay**.

I am an Economics major at the University of Notre Dame, set to graduate in 2027. I have minors in Foundations of Business & Computing and Digital Technologies. I am originally from Birmingham, Michigan. In my free time, I enjoy reading, travel, making playlists, and spending time with friends.

- âš¡ I'm looking forward to learning more about GitHub.
